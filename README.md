# WhatsApp Chat Analysis
- Overview
This project is designed to analyze WhatsApp group chat data by converting the chat history into a structured CSV file format. The analysis includes descriptive, predictive, and diagnostic studies, providing insights into communication patterns, user behavior, and potential trends within the chat.

- Key Features
Data Extraction: The raw WhatsApp chat is parsed and converted into a structured CSV file, preserving essential metadata such as timestamps, sender names, and message content.

- Descriptive Analysis:

  - Statistical Summary: Provides basic statistics like the total number of messages, average messages per day, active hours, and word frequency.
  - User Activity: Analyzes participation metrics, including the number of messages sent by each user, the frequency of their contributions over time, and their most active periods.
  - Content Analysis: Examines word and emoji usage, identifies common phrases, and categorizes message types (text, media, links, etc.).
Predictive Analysis:

  - Trend Prediction: Uses time-series analysis to predict future communication patterns based on historical data.
Sentiment Analysis: Applies machine learning models to predict the sentiment of messages over time, providing insights into the emotional tone of the group conversation.

- Diagnostic Analysis:

  - Anomaly Detection: Identifies outliers or unusual behavior in the chat, such as sudden spikes in activity or unexpected sentiment shifts.
Conversation Dynamics: Analyzes interaction patterns, such as response times and the flow of dialogue between participants, to understand group dynamics.
Technical Workflow
Data Parsing:

  - The WhatsApp chat export is read and parsed using custom text processing algorithms.
Relevant metadata (timestamps, sender, message content) is extracted and normalized into a CSV format.

- Data Preprocessing:

The extracted data undergoes cleaning and transformation, including handling missing values, normalizing text, and encoding categorical variables.
Time-series data is resampled to handle irregular intervals between messages.
- Descriptive Analysis:

  - Statistical methods and visualization tools (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) are used to generate descriptive statistics and visualize communication patterns.
